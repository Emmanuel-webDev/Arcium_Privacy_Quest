### 🧠 What You Will Learn

The Quest makes high-level privacy technology accessible and fun by explaining:

* **Confidential Computing:** How to process data in a "black box" where even the host can't see it.
* **Multi-Party Computation (MPC):** How multiple parties can compute a result together without any single party seeing the underlying input data.
* **Decentralization Benefits:** Why removing a central authority eliminates single points of failure and trust.
* **Privacy-First Infrastructure:** Understanding why privacy should be built into the code, not added as an afterthought.
